# MHXR-Model-Tool
A tool to export and possibly import .mods from Monster Hunter Explore. Yes, I know it isn't active. It's a learning exercise and a favor to a certain model man who may not know I charge by the hour. 

I had started just by fixing the 3ds max script by Zaramot, but ended up deciding that making my own tool independent of 3ds Max would be fun. I might also try to get importing working. 

I might even also use this tool as a basis for an Import/Export tool for all the monster hunter games I am interested in.
